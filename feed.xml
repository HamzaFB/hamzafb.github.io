<p>In this post I am going to explain the graphical model <em>Bayesian Online
Change Point Detection</em> introduced in <a class="citation" href="#adams2007bayesian">(Adams &amp; MacKay, 2007)</a> that has known many extensions over the last few years.<br />
Given a time series, we are interested in detecting structural changes
as new data comes in <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.<br />
A great explanation of this paper can be found in <a class="citation" href="#gundersen">(Gundersen, 2022)</a>].<br />
You might ask, why reading this post then? There is three main reasons.<br />
First, I will try to clarify parts that were not trivial to me despite
reading the post above (e.g. a tiny mistake was made in the math
derivation).<br />
Second and most importantly the paper only provide a way to calculate
the probability that there was a change-point k units of time ago, but
it does not propose a strategy to segment the time-series. I will
propose as an extension<br />
Finally, I will show how we can use BOCPD to detect trend changes.</p>

<h1 id="bocpd">BOCPD</h1>

<p>Let \(\{x_{1}, ... x_{T}\}\in \mathbf{R}^{T\times d}\) denote the time
series of interest.</p>

<h2 id="introducing-the-main-ingredient-run-length">Introducing the main ingredient: Run-length</h2>

<p>Let \(r_{t}\), the <em>run-length</em>, be a random variable that represent the
time since the last change-point. For instance, \(r_{t} = j\) implies that
the last change-point was at time t-j.<br />
It follows that \(r_{t} \in \mathbf{R}^{t}\) and \(r_{t} = \begin{cases}
0 \text{     if change-point at time $t$} \\
r_{t-1} + 1 \text{     else} \end{cases}\)</p>

<p><br />
In the BOCPD model, our main interest lies in calculating the run-length
posterior distribution \(P(r_{t}|x_{1:t})\).<br />
In order to do compute it we need to make some assumptions around:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>the conditional dependence structure between \(\{x_{1}, ... x_{T}\}\)
and \(\{r_{1}, ... r_{T}\}\)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the underlying distribution of \(\{x_{1}, ... x_{T}\}\) and
\(\{r_{1}, ... r_{T}\}\)</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="conditional-dependence-structure-assumptions">Conditional dependence structure assumptions</h2>

<p>The assumptions that we are going to explain in more details are
outlined in the graphical representation above.<br />
<ins>Assumption 1:</ins> We assume that \(r_{t}\) is conditionally
independent of everything else given \(r_{t-1}\). In other words
\(P(r_{t} | r_{t-1}, x_{1:t}) = P(r_{t} | r_{t-1})\)<br />
<ins>Assumption 2:</ins> We assume that the current observation only
depends on the past observations associated to the current partition
defined be the run-length, i.e.
\(P(x_{t} | r_{t-1}=r, x_{1:t-1}) = P(x_{t} | x_{t-r-1:t-1})\)<br />
With these two assumptions, we can derive our main objective
\(P(r_{t}|x_{1:t})\).<br />
Given that
\(P(r_{t}|x_{1:t}) = \frac{P(r_{t},x_{1:t})}{\sum_{r'_{t}}P(r'_{t},x_{1:t})}\),
we just need to solve for \(P(r_{t},x_{1:t})\). \(\begin{aligned}
P(r_{t},x_{1:t}) =&amp; \sum_{r_{t-1}} P(r_{t}, r_{t-1}, x_{1:t})  \text{      (by marginalizing over $r_{t-1}$)}\\ =&amp; \sum_{r_{t-1}} P(r_{t}, x_{t} | r_{t-1}, x_{1:t-1})P(r_{t-1}, x_{1:t-1}) \text{     (by bayes rule)}\\ =&amp;  \sum_{r_{t-1}} P(r_{t}| x_{t} , r_{t-1}, x_{1:t-1})  P( x_{t} | r_{t-1}, x_{1:t-1}) P(r_{t-1}, x_{1:t-1}) \text{      (by bayes rule)} \\ =&amp;  \sum_{r_{t-1}} P(r_{t}|  r_{t-1})  P( x_{t} | r_{t-1}, x_{t-1- r_{t-1}:t-1}) P(r_{t-1}, x_{1:t-1}) \quad \text{ (by assumption 1 and 2)}
\end{aligned}\)<br />
Three terms appear in the equations above:<br />
\(P(r_{t},x_{1:t}) = \sum_{r_{t-1}} \underbrace{P(r_{t}|  r_{t-1})}_{\text{Changepoint Prior}}   \underbrace{P( x_{t} | r_{t-1}, x_{t-1- r_{t-1}:t-1})}_{\text{Underlying Predictive Model}} \underbrace{P(r_{t-1}, x_{1:t-1})}_{\text{Message}}\)<br />
We now need to make assumptions on the distribution of the Change-point
Prior and the Underlying Predictive Model in order to be able to
recursively derive the run-length posterior.</p>

<h2 id="underlying-distribution-assumptions">Underlying distribution assumptions</h2>

<h3 id="change-point-prior-model">Change-point prior model</h3>

<p>The transition probability \(P(r_{t}|r_{t-1})\) is assumed to follow the
below distribution: \(P(r_{t}|r_{t-1}) = \begin{cases}
H(r_{t-1} + 1) \quad \text{if   } r_t = 0
\\
1 - H(r_{t-1} + 1) \quad \text{if }r_t = r_{t-1} + 1
\\
0 \quad \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}\) <br />
where  \(H(\tau) = \frac{p_{g}(\tau)}{\sum_{t=\tau}^{\infty}p_{g}(t)}\) is the
hazard function<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> and \(p_{g}(t)\) represents the probability of a
segment of length t. If we set \(p_{g}\) to follow a geometric
distribution with parameter \(\lambda\) then
\(H(\tau) = \frac{1}{\lambda}\). The prior \(\lambda\) encodes our belief on
the expected length of a segment, in other words our prior on the
average length of a partition.</p>

<h3 id="predictive-model-assumptions">Predictive Model assumptions</h3>

<p>The last part we need to compute is the predictive probability
\(P( x_{t} | r_{t-1}, x_{t-1- r_{t-1}:t-1})\).<br />
<br />
<ins>Assumption 3:</ins> We assume that \(x_{t}\) follows a
distribution with parameter \(\eta\) (where \(\eta\) is a random quantity in
a bayesian framework). \(\eta\) is shared across all the \(x_{i}\) within a
segment (defined by the run-length).<br />
<br />
This assumption results from the product partition model.<br />
Given our new point, we are trying to estimate the probability that this
point belongs to the current partition.<br />
\(P( x_{t} | r_{t-1}, x_{t-1- r_{t-1}:t-1}) = \int P( x_{t} | \eta, r_{t-1}, x_{t-1- r_{t-1}:t-1}) P( \eta | r_{t-1}, x_{t-1- r_{t-1}:t-1})d \eta\)<br />
<br />
<ins>Assumption 4:</ins>
\(x_{t} \perp\kern-5pt\perp  r_{t-1}, x_{t-1- r_{t-1}:t-1} |\eta\).<br />
<br />
Under this assumption, we obtain:<br />
\(P( x_{t} | r_{t-1}, x_{t-1- r_{t-1}:t-1}) = \int \underbrace{P( x_{t}| \eta)}_\text{underlying model}  \underbrace{P( \eta | r_{t-1}, x_{t-1- r_{t-1}:t-1})}_{\text{Posterior Distribution}}d \eta\).<br />
We now need to define the distribution underlying model and the
disribution of the prior $\eta$.<br />
The law \(x_{t} | \eta\) that we choose defines the type of change-points
we wish to detect.<br />
If we are interested in detecting abrupt shifts in the mean, we could
then choose a Gaussian distribution.<br />
If we have count data, we could be tempted to choose a Poisson
distribution. If we have are interested in changes in the trend, we
could choose a Bayesian linear regression with time as a regressor.<br />
<br />
In <a class="citation" href="#adams2007bayesian">(Adams &amp; MacKay, 2007)</a>, \(P( x_{t}| \eta)\) is restricted to come from
the Exponential Family and the prior \(P(\eta)\) is restricted to be a
conjugate prior (which means that
\(P( \eta | r_{t-1}, x_{t-1- r_{t-1}:t-1})\) and \(P(\eta)\) come from the
same family distribution).<br />
<br />
The choice of Exponential family + conjugate prior is motivated by a
trade-off between tractability of the equations and generalization over
the type of change-points that can be detected:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The conjugate prior allows for a tractable derivation of the
posterior distribution as we obtain a closed-form of the posterior
distribution. The main derivation needed is on the hyper-parameters
associated with the posterior distribution. In the case of an
Exponential Family likelihood, the hyper-parameters have an easy
formula that can be updated sequentially, a very appealing property
in the case of sequential learning.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Exponential Family encompasses a lot of widely used family for
change-point detection problems (e.g. normal distribution, poisson
distribution, bayesian linear regression...).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most of the exponential family distributions lead to a closed form
of the predictive probability when the prior is conjugate, which
avoids us to resort to bayesian approximation techniques that are
computationally costly.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="an-offline-strategy-a-viterbi-like-algorithm">An offline strategy: a viterbi-like algorithm</h2>

<p>A natural criteria to find the best segmentation up until time t is to
find the Maximum A Posteriori sequence of run-length, i.e. the most
probable sequence of run-length:<br />
\(r^{*}_{1}, ... r^{*}_{t} = arg \max\limits_{r_{1}, ... r_{t}} P(r_{1}, ... r_{t} | x_{1}, ..., x_{t})\)<br />
By noticing that:  \(arg \max\limits_{r_{1}, ... r_{t}} P(r_{1}, ... r_{t} | x_{1}, ..., x_{t}) =  arg \max\limits_{r_{1}, ... r_{t}} P(r_{1}, ... r_{t} , x_{1}, ..., x_{t})\)
We will optimize \(P(r_{1}, ... r_{t} , x_{1}, ..., x_{t})\) through a dynamic programming algorithm.</p>

<p>This optimization formulation is the same as the Viterbi Algorithm used
for Hidden Markov Models.<br />
However, the structural dependencies are slightly different, hence the
recursion is slightly different. Figure <a href="#graphicalmodel">1</a>
illustrates the structural dependencies in BOCPD.<br />
\(\begin{aligned}
    P(r_{1}, ..., r_{t} , x_{1}, ..., x_{t}) =&amp; P( r_{t} | r_{1}, ..., r_{t-1}, x_{1}, ..., x_{t}) P(r_{1}, ..., r_{t-1}, , x_{1}, ..., x_{t}) \\ =&amp; P( r_{t} | r_{1}, ..., r_{t-1}, x_{1}, ..., x_{t}) P( x_{t} | r_{1}, ..., r_{t-1}, x_{1}, ..., x_{t-1}) P(r_{1}, ..., r_{t-1} , x_{1}, ..., x_{t-1})
    \\ =&amp; P( r_{t} | r_{t-1}) P( x_{t} | r_{t-1}, x_{1}, ..., x_{t-1}) P(r_{1}, ..., r_{t-1} , x_{1}, ..., x_{t-1})
\end{aligned}\)
 Now let’s introduce a few notations:<br />
Let
\(\delta_{t}(j) \overset{\Delta}{=}  \log P(r_{1}, ..., r_{t}=j, x_{1}, ..., x_{t})\).<br />
Let \(A(i,j)  \overset{\Delta}{=} \log P(r_{t}=j|r_{t-1}=i)\).<br />
Let
\(\lambda(i)  \overset{\Delta}{=} \log P( x_{t} = i| r_{t-1}, x_{1}, ..., x_{t-1})\).<br />
Using the equation above, we get:<br />
\(\delta_{t}(j) = \max\limits_{i} A(i,j) + \lambda(i) +\delta_{t-1}(i)\)<br />
The recursion above allows us to compute the optimal sequence of
run-length at each time step.<br />
An important drawback is the time and space complexity of this
algorithm.<br />
The space complexity is \(O(T^{2})\) while the computational complexity is
\(O(T)\).</p>

<h2 id="an-online-strategy">An online strategy</h2>

<p>In the online change-point setting, we are above all interested in
detecting a new change-point with minimum delay (more than finding
retrospectively the optimal segmentation).<br />
An easy and natural strategy would be to detect an alert if the
run-length posterior distribution
\(P(r_{t} = l| x_{1}, ..., x_{t}) &gt; \text{threshold}\).<br />
There is two parameters to consider here. The parameter \(l\) directly
encodes the detection delay with which we will flag a change-point. The
threshold encodes the confidence degree with which we will flag a
change-point.<br />
One issue with this methodology is that we will generally detect
multiple consecutive change-points.</p>
